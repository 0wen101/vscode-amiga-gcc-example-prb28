The default installation folder is **c:\amiga-gcc** and is the expected path for this setup in VS Code. If a different install path is chosen, then you'll need to update any references in  VS Code.

``note: this installs a 64-bit version of gcc.exe.``

After gcc install, run **cmdline.bat** in the installation folder. 
This will tell you the compiler is actually working but it also to creates a make.exe file which is used later by our Makefile.

Also on https://franke.ms/Downloads.wiki#Amiga is bgdbserver which is used for source level debugging.
<br>v1.3 is alreay located in the uae\DH0\c folder but may be worth checking if there is a newer version from Bebbo.
