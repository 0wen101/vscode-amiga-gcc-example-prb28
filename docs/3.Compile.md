Compile
====
The actual code is a very simple hello word c file that outputs a 'Hello!' greeting:
1. using C Standard Library (stdio) 
2. using the Amiga's own dos library.

With the workspace open, click on hello.c. There should a) be intellisense and b) no red 'squiggles' underlining any of the code.
<br>If there are, it probably indicates compiler path configuration settings. You can check these in the c_cpp_properties.json file in the .vscode folder.

Next, press **Ctrl Shift B** or click the Terminal menu and select 'Run Build Task..'.
<br>This will compile and link the source file via the Makefile to create an Amiga executable

An object file (hello.o) should be created in the 'build-gcc' folder, an amiga executable file (hello) in the fs-uae\hd0 folder.

**Errors**
<br>If Bebbos toolchain (**setup-amiga-gcc-exe**) is not configured correctly, a typical error you would be:
```
make : The term 'make' is not recognized as the name of a 
cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check   
the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify 
that the path is correct and try again.
```
Check the toolchain  is installed and you have ran the cmdline.bat file there to create that missing make.exe file for you. 

Also check the amiga-gcc\bin folder has been added to your Windows path.

``note: for the path you can use either the Windows path environment variable or the path stored in the VS Code settings for the workspace.``

To see the VS Code path, go to the Terminal Window in VS Code and run this command:

```
echo $env:path
```
To edit the VS Code Path, press Ctrl-Shift-P, select 'Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)' and then edit this line
```
"terminal.integrated.env.windows": {
        "PATH": "c:\\amiga-gcc\\bin;"
    },
```
